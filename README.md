Rock Paper Scissors Artificially Somewhat Intelligent Program (RPS-ASIP)
Charlie Smith
2020

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors machine learning program that attempts to beat the
user in the long run by learning the users game play.

Run this program by going to the scripts folder and running './run.sh' with any desired
flags and the rest will be prompted to you once the program starts. For the visual graph
of real time and past progress against the computer (-G to activate), the user must have 
matplotlib and python 3.

A save file will be generated in the data folder using the name that you provide so if 
you come back and play later, the memory of your past games will still be of use.
